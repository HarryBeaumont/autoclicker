# A Little Auto-Clicker

I got tired of manually clicking in games like cookie clicker. This was a fun little exercise in python using threads.

##

Use 
```
pipenv install
```
to install the dependencies (of which there is one), then run with 

```
pipenv run python3 autoclicker.py
``` 

##

Press `a` to toggle the autoclicker on and off, and `b` to quit the application. The autoclicker will only work if your mouse is still, if you move the cursor it will stop automatically (so you don't accidently spam click anything).
